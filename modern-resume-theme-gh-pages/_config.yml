  Hi, my name's Claire.

  I just graduated May 2020 from Reed College in Portland, OR as an Economics and Mathematics major. I'm particulary intrested in behavioral econ and wrote an undergraduate [thesis](https://github.com/zumiko/thesis) on peer effects with online crowdfunding. In my free time, I like to climb, slackline, and visit parks.
