I just graduated from Reed College in Portland, OR as an Economics and Mathematics major. As part of that, I wrote an undergraduate thesis on peer effects with online crowdfunding. In my free time, I like to climb, slackline, visit parks, over analyze tv shows and books, and run on flat surfaces. I don't think I really have a enough to write about to warrant a website, but thought I'd make one and see if things gradually accumulate.
