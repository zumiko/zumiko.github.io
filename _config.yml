  I grew up in Bishop, CA (mule capital of the world). From there, I moved to Portland, OR to attend Reed College. At Reed, I double majored in math and econ 
  and wrote my senior [thesis](https://github.com/zumiko/thesis) on peer effects within online crowdfunding. After grauduating, 
  I interned remotely for the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and then briefly at Texas A&M. After that, I moved to Philadelphia
  to join the Research Department at the Fed where I work on empirical macro, policy briefings, and improving my 
  ping pong skills. 

  In my free time, I like to climb, slackline, and coach soccer.
