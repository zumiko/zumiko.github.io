  Hi, I'm Claire. 

  I graduated May 2020 from Reed College in Portland, OR as an Economics and Mathematics major. 
  I'm particulary intrested in behavioral econ and wrote an undergraduate [thesis](https://github.com/zumiko/thesis) on peer effects within online crowdfunding. 
  I also recently wrote a short [piece](https://reedquest.org/articles/2020/2/28/algorithms-of-oppression-dr-safiya-noble-discusses-racism-in-google-search-results?rq=claire%20jellison) for the college newspaper covering a talk about how search engines serve to reinforce racism.
  In my free time, I like to climb, slackline, and visit parks.
